# 🔐 feat: introduce organization_admin role system

## 📋 Summary

Introduces a normalized organization + role system that replaces the legacy `companies/company_members` structure with `organizations/org_members/user_roles`. The key addition is the `organization_admin` role that provides elevated access to the admin portal.

## 🎯 Key Changes

### 🗄️ Database Migration
- **`supabase/migrations/20250929_introduce_role_system.sql`**
  - Creates `organizations` table (replaces `companies`)
  - Creates `org_members` table (replaces `company_members`)
  - Creates `user_roles` table for centralized role management
  - Migrates existing data if present
  - Sets up RLS policies and triggers

### 🔀 Role Routing Updates
- **`packages/shared/src/role-routing.ts`**
  - `organization_admin` → `https://admin.autamedica.com` (admin portal)
  - `company` → `https://companies.autamedica.com` (companies portal)
  - `company_admin` → companies portal (legacy compatibility)
  - Updated all role mappings with new UserRole types

### 🔧 TypeScript Fixes
- Fixed exports in `packages/shared/package.json` and `packages/types/package.json`
- Updated UserRole type to include `company` and `organization_admin`
- Fixed Set iteration compatibility issue in `packages/shared/src/env.ts`

## 🧪 Testing & Validation

### ✅ Unit Tests Added
- **`packages/shared/__tests__/role-routing.test.ts`** (29 tests)
  - Portal routing validation for all roles
  - URL generation with custom paths
  - Legacy `company_admin` compatibility
  - Error handling for invalid roles
  - Mapping consistency validation

### 🌱 Seeds & Test Data
- **`supabase/seed_role_system.sql`**
  - Test organization: "Clínica Demo AutaMedica"
  - User roles for all role types
  - Organization memberships
  - Verification queries

### ⚙️ CI/CD Pipeline
- **`.github/workflows/role-system-validation.yml`**
  - DB types generation validation (no diffs allowed)
  - Glossary/contracts validation (`docs:validate`)
  - TypeScript, ESLint, and build validation
  - Automatic role routing tests

## 🔄 Migration Process

### 1. Apply Migration
```bash
# Via Supabase Dashboard SQL Editor (COMPLETED ✅)
# Copy content from: supabase/migrations/20250929_introduce_role_system.sql
```

### 2. Apply Seeds (Optional)
```bash
psql "$SUPABASE_DB_URL" -f supabase/seed_role_system.sql
```

### 3. Regenerate Types
```bash
pnpm -w db:generate  # Should show no changes (already applied)
```

## 🚀 Expected Behavior

### Role Redirects
- **organization_admin** → Admin Dashboard (`/dashboard`)
- **company** → Companies Portal
- **company_admin** → Companies Portal (legacy)
- **doctor** → Doctors Portal (unchanged)
- **patient** → Patients Portal (unchanged)
- **platform_admin** → Main Landing (unchanged)

### Middleware Protection
- Routes validate user roles via updated `getPortalForRole()`
- Invalid roles return 403 Forbidden
- Unauthenticated users redirect to login

## 🧪 Testing Checklist

- [x] Migration applied successfully in Supabase
- [x] Database types generated without diffs
- [x] TypeScript compilation passes (`pnpm -w typecheck`)
- [x] ESLint validation passes (`pnpm -w lint`)
- [x] Build succeeds (`pnpm -w build`)
- [x] Unit tests pass (29/29 role routing tests ✅)
- [ ] Manual login test: `organization_admin` → admin portal
- [ ] Manual login test: `company` → companies portal
- [ ] RLS policies working correctly

## 🛡️ Security & Compatibility

### ✅ Security
- RLS policies protect all new tables
- Role validation prevents privilege escalation
- No breaking changes to existing auth flows

### ✅ Backward Compatibility
- `company_admin` role still works (maps to companies portal)
- Helper `normalizeRole()` handles legacy mappings
- Existing APIs unchanged

### ✅ Rollback Plan
- Migration includes `IF NOT EXISTS` for safety
- Legacy tables preserved during transition
- Can create compatibility views if needed:
  ```sql
  CREATE VIEW companies AS SELECT * FROM organizations;
  CREATE VIEW company_members AS SELECT * FROM org_members;
  ```

```bash
✅ Database migration applied
✅ Types generated (0 diffs)
✅ TypeScript compilation

✅ Build successful
✅ Unit tests: 29/29 passing
✅ CI/CD pipeline configured
