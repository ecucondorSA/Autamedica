| **Build Integrity** | Turbo build verification | ✅ Validated |
| **Test Coverage** | Test suite execution | ✅ Validated |
| **Dependency Security** | pnpm audit + overrides | ✅ Validated |
| **Secrets Protection** | Gitleaks scanning | ✅ Validated |
| **Security Headers** | Headers file validation | ✅ Validated |
| **CORS Security** | CORS implementation check | ✅ Validated |
| **Database Security** | RLS + audit triggers | ✅ Validated |
| **Vulnerability Management** | CVE override validation | ✅ Validated |

### 🛡️ Security Gates Implementation

#### Pre-Merge Security Gates
1. **Code Quality Gate:** All code must pass linting and type checking
2. **Build Gate:** All packages and apps must build successfully
3. **Test Gate:** All tests must pass
4. **Security Audit Gate:** No high/critical vulnerabilities allowed
5. **Secrets Gate:** No secrets or sensitive data in code
6. **Headers Gate:** Security headers must be properly configured
7. **CORS Gate:** CORS must be properly implemented
8. **Database Gate:** Database schema must be secure

#### Pre-Deploy Security Gates
1. **Final Validation:** All security measures must be validated
2. **Report Generation:** Security report must be generated
3. **Artifact Upload:** Security artifacts must be uploaded

### 🚀 Workflow Performance

#### Execution Time
- **Total Runtime:** ~10-15 minutes
- **Parallel Jobs:** 5 parallel security validation jobs
- **Efficient Execution:** Optimized for speed and thoroughness

#### Resource Usage
