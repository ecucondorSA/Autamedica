# Code Build Audit Report

**Date:** $(date)  
**Agent:** code_audit_autofix  
**Status:** ⚠️ PARTIAL SUCCESS

## Summary

The code audit and autofix process has been executed with mixed results. While the linting process completed successfully, there are build failures that need to be addressed.

## Results

### ✅ Successful Operations
- **pnpm version:** 9.15.2
- **node version:** v22.20.0
- **Dependencies installed:** Successfully installed with frozen lockfile
- **Linting completed:** All packages linted successfully
- **Autofix applied:** ESLint autofix was applied to all packages

### ⚠️ Issues Found

#### Build Failures
1. **@autamedica/web-app build failure:**
   - **Error:** Module not found: Can't resolve '@supabase/auth-helpers-nextjs'
   - **Location:** ./src/middleware.ts:1:1
   - **Impact:** Critical - prevents web-app from building

2. **@autamedica/companies build warning:**
   - **Warning:** 'canManageCompany' is not exported from '@autamedica/shared/roles'
   - **Location:** ./src/app/layout.tsx
   - **Impact:** Medium - compilation warning but build succeeds

#### Linting Warnings (Non-blocking)
- Multiple TypeScript warnings across packages:
  - Unexpected `any` types
  - Forbidden non-null assertions
  - Unused variables
  - Missing Next.js ESLint plugin configuration

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions Required
1. **Fix web-app dependency:**
   ```bash
   cd apps/web-app
   pnpm add @supabase/auth-helpers-nextjs
   ```

2. **Fix shared roles export:**
   - Add `canManageCompany` export to `packages/shared/src/roles.ts`
   - Or update companies app to use correct import

### Code Quality Improvements
1. **TypeScript strictness:**
   - Replace `any` types with proper type definitions
   - Remove non-null assertions where possible
   - Clean up unused variables

2. **ESLint configuration:**
   - Add Next.js ESLint plugin to all Next.js apps
   - Consider migrating from deprecated `next lint` to ESLint CLI
