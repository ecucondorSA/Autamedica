### 🛡️ Security Improvements

#### Before Overrides
- ❌ path-to-regexp vulnerable to ReDoS attacks
- ❌ cookie vulnerable to XSS attacks
- ❌ No centralized vulnerability management
- ❌ Inconsistent dependency versions

#### After Overrides
- ✅ path-to-regexp upgraded to secure version
- ✅ cookie upgraded to secure version
- ✅ Centralized override configuration
- ✅ Consistent secure versions across all packages

### 📋 Recommendations

#### Immediate Actions
1. **Monitor Remaining Vulnerabilities:**
   - Track undici vulnerabilities for updates
   - Monitor esbuild for development server issues

2. **Regular Security Audits:**
   - Run `pnpm audit` regularly
   - Update overrides as new patches become available

#### Long-term Security
1. **Dependency Management:**
   - Consider using `pnpm audit --fix` for automatic fixes
   - Implement automated security scanning in CI/CD

2. **Vulnerability Monitoring:**
   - Set up alerts for new CVEs
   - Regular dependency updates

### 🔧 Implementation Details

#### Files Modified
- `package.json` - Added pnpm overrides section
- `generated-docs/pnpm-audit.json` - Full audit report

#### Override Strategy
- **Selective Overrides:** Only override packages with known vulnerabilities
- **Version Pinning:** Use specific versions to ensure consistency
- **Regular Updates:** Monitor for newer secure versions

### 🚀 Next Steps

1. **Deploy Updated Dependencies:**
   - Ensure all environments use the updated dependencies
   - Test applications with new dependency versions

2. **Monitor Security:**
   - Set up automated security scanning
   - Track new vulnerabilities in dependencies

3. **Update Overrides:**
   - Add new overrides as vulnerabilities are discovered
   - Remove overrides when packages are updated
