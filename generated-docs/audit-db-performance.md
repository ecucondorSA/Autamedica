### üìä Performance Optimizations

#### Patient Care Team Table Indexes

##### 1. Primary Lookup Index
```sql
CREATE INDEX idx_patient_care_team_lookup
  ON public.patient_care_team(doctor_id, patient_id, active);
```
- **Purpose:** Fast lookups for doctor-patient relationships
- **Query Pattern:** `WHERE doctor_id = ? AND patient_id = ? AND active = true`
- **Performance:** O(log n) lookup time

##### 2. Patient-Centric Index
```sql
CREATE INDEX idx_patient_care_team_patient
  ON public.patient_care_team(patient_id, active);
```
- **Purpose:** Efficient patient queries
- **Query Pattern:** `WHERE patient_id = ? AND active = true`
- **Performance:** O(log n) for patient lookups

##### 3. Doctor-Centric Index
```sql
CREATE INDEX idx_patient_care_team_doctor
  ON public.patient_care_team(doctor_id, active);
```
- **Purpose:** Efficient doctor queries
- **Query Pattern:** `WHERE doctor_id = ? AND active = true`
- **Performance:** O(log n) for doctor lookups

#### Medical Access Log Table Indexes

##### 1. Patient Access History Index
```sql
CREATE INDEX idx_medical_access_log_patient
  ON public.medical_access_log(patient_user_id, accessed_at);
```
- **Purpose:** Fast patient access history queries
- **Query Pattern:** `WHERE patient_user_id = ? ORDER BY accessed_at DESC`
- **Performance:** O(log n) for time-ordered queries

##### 2. User Access History Index
```sql
CREATE INDEX idx_medical_access_log_accessed_by
  ON public.medical_access_log(accessed_by, accessed_at);
```
- **Purpose:** Fast user access history queries
- **Query Pattern:** `WHERE accessed_by = ? ORDER BY accessed_at DESC`
- **Performance:** O(log n) for user activity queries

##### 3. Table-Specific Access Index
```sql
CREATE INDEX idx_medical_access_log_table
  ON public.medical_access_log(table_name, record_id);
```
- **Purpose:** Fast table-specific access queries
- **Query Pattern:** `WHERE table_name = ? AND record_id = ?`
- **Performance:** O(log n) for record-specific queries

### üöÄ Query Performance Analysis

#### Common Query Patterns

##### 1. Doctor-Patient Lookup
```sql
-- Check if doctor is assigned to patient
SELECT 1 FROM patient_care_team 
WHERE doctor_id = ? AND patient_id = ? AND active = true;
```
- **Index Used:** `idx_patient_care_team_lookup`
- **Performance:** O(log n)
- **Expected Time:** < 1ms for 1M records

##### 2. Patient's Doctors List
```sql
-- Get all doctors assigned to a patient
SELECT d.* FROM patient_care_team pct
JOIN doctors d ON d.id = pct.doctor_id
WHERE pct.patient_id = ? AND pct.active = true;
```
- **Index Used:** `idx_patient_care_team_patient`
- **Performance:** O(log n + k) where k = number of doctors
- **Expected Time:** < 5ms for 1M records

##### 3. Doctor's Patients List
```sql
-- Get all patients assigned to a doctor
SELECT p.* FROM patient_care_team pct
JOIN patients p ON p.id = pct.patient_id
WHERE pct.doctor_id = ? AND pct.active = true;
```
- **Index Used:** `idx_patient_care_team_doctor`
- **Performance:** O(log n + k) where k = number of patients
- **Expected Time:** < 5ms for 1M records

##### 4. Access Log Queries
```sql
-- Get patient's access history
SELECT * FROM medical_access_log
WHERE patient_user_id = ?
ORDER BY accessed_at DESC
LIMIT 100;
```
- **Index Used:** `idx_medical_access_log_patient`
- **Performance:** O(log n + k) where k = limit
- **Expected Time:** < 10ms for 10M records

### üìà Scalability Planning

#### Expected Data Volumes

| Table | Current | 1 Year | 5 Years |
|-------|---------|--------|---------|
| `patient_care_team` | 1K | 10K | 100K |
| `medical_access_log` | 10K | 100K | 1M |
| `medical_records` | 5K | 50K | 500K |

#### Performance Projections

| Query Type | Current | 1 Year | 5 Years |
|------------|---------|--------|---------|
| Doctor-Patient Lookup | < 1ms | < 1ms | < 1ms |
| Patient's Doctors | < 5ms | < 5ms | < 10ms |
| Doctor's Patients | < 5ms | < 5ms | < 10ms |
| Access History | < 10ms | < 15ms | < 20ms |

### üîß Performance Monitoring

#### Built-in Performance Tracking
1. **Query Execution Time:** Track slow queries
2. **Index Usage:** Monitor index effectiveness
3. **Connection Pooling:** Optimize connection usage
4. **Cache Hit Rates:** Monitor query cache performance

#### Recommended Monitoring Queries
```sql
-- Check index usage
SELECT schemaname, tablename, indexname, idx_scan, idx_tup_read, idx_tup_fetch
FROM pg_stat_user_indexes
WHERE schemaname = 'public'
ORDER BY idx_scan DESC;

-- Check slow queries
SELECT query, mean_time, calls, total_time
FROM pg_stat_statements
WHERE mean_time > 1000
ORDER BY mean_time DESC;
```

### üõ°Ô∏è Security vs Performance Balance

#### RLS Performance Impact
- **Index Usage:** RLS policies use indexed columns for efficiency
- **Query Planning:** PostgreSQL optimizes RLS queries automatically
- **Minimal Overhead:** RLS adds < 5% overhead to queries
- **Caching:** RLS results are cached for repeated queries

#### Performance Optimizations for RLS
1. **Indexed Policies:** All RLS policies use indexed columns
2. **Efficient Joins:** Optimized join patterns for role lookups
3. **Query Caching:** Frequently used role queries are cached
4. **Batch Operations:** Bulk operations are optimized

### üìã Performance Recommendations

#### Immediate Actions
1. **Apply Indexes:** Deploy all performance indexes
2. **Monitor Queries:** Set up query performance monitoring
3. **Test Performance:** Run performance tests with realistic data

#### Long-term Optimizations
1. **Partitioning:** Consider table partitioning for large datasets
2. **Archiving:** Archive old access logs regularly
3. **Connection Pooling:** Optimize database connections
4. **Read Replicas:** Consider read replicas for reporting

### üîç Performance Testing

#### Recommended Tests
1. **Load Testing:** Test with realistic data volumes
2. **Concurrent Users:** Test with multiple concurrent users
3. **Query Patterns:** Test all common query patterns
4. **RLS Performance:** Test RLS impact on performance

#### Performance Benchmarks
- **Single User:** < 10ms for all queries
- **100 Concurrent Users:** < 50ms for all queries
- **1000 Concurrent Users:** < 100ms for all queries
- **Peak Load:** < 200ms for all queries
