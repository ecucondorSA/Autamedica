## 🔄 Next Steps (In Order)

### 1. 🌱 Apply Seeds (Required for Testing)

**Option A: Supabase Dashboard** (Recommended)
- Go to: https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/gtyvdircfhmdjiaelqkg/sql
- Copy content from: `supabase/seed_role_system.sql`
- Execute the script

**Option B: CLI** (If you have local psql)
```bash
psql "$SUPABASE_DB_URL" -f supabase/seed_role_system.sql
```

### 2. 🧪 Manual Testing

After applying seeds, test these scenarios:

**Test A: organization_admin routing**
- User ID: `a0eebc99-9c0b-4ef8-bb6d-6bb9bd380a11`
- Expected: Redirect to admin portal
- URL: `https://admin.autamedica.com`

**Test B: company role routing**
- User ID: `b0eebc99-9c0b-4ef8-bb6d-6bb9bd380a12`
- Expected: Redirect to companies portal
- URL: `https://companies.autamedica.com`

**Verification Queries:**
```sql
-- Check organization created
SELECT id, name, slug FROM organizations WHERE id = '00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000111';

-- Check user roles
SELECT user_id, role FROM user_roles WHERE metadata->>'seed' = 'true';

-- Check org memberships
SELECT org_id, user_id, role FROM org_members WHERE org_id = '00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000111';
```

### 3. 📋 PR Review Checklist

**Technical Review:**
- [ ] Database migration script is safe and reversible
- [ ] TypeScript types are consistent across packages
- [ ] Role routing logic handles all edge cases
- [ ] Unit tests cover critical functionality (29 tests)
- [ ] No breaking changes to existing auth flows

**Functional Review:**
- [ ] `organization_admin` goes to admin portal
- [ ] `company` goes to companies portal
- [ ] `company_admin` legacy support maintained
- [ ] All other roles work as before
- [ ] Error handling for invalid roles

### 4. 🚀 Deploy to Staging

Once PR is approved:
```bash
# Merge PR
gh pr merge 5 --squash

# Deploy to staging (if auto-deploy not configured)
git checkout main
git pull origin main
# [Your staging deployment process]
```

### 5. ✅ Production Deployment

**Pre-production checklist:**
- [ ] Staging tests pass
- [ ] Manual testing complete
- [ ] Performance impact assessed
- [ ] Rollback plan confirmed
- [ ] Team notified of changes

## 🛡️ Rollback Plan

If issues arise, rollback options:

**1. Code Rollback:**
```bash
git revert [commit-hash]
```

**2. Database Rollback:**
```sql
-- Quick rollback (if needed)
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS user_roles;
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS org_members;
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS organizations;
-- Existing tables (companies, company_members) are preserved
```

**3. Legacy Compatibility:**
- `company_admin` role still maps to companies portal
- No breaking changes to existing auth flows
- `normalizeRole()` helper handles legacy mappings

## 📈 Impact Assessment

### ✅ Low Risk Changes
- New tables don't affect existing data
- TypeScript changes are additive
- Role routing is backwards compatible
- Comprehensive test coverage

### ⚠️ Monitor After Deployment
- Login flow for organization_admin users
- Portal redirects working correctly
- RLS policies performing well
- No auth errors in logs

## 🎯 Success Criteria

**Deployment is successful when:**
- [ ] organization_admin users land on admin portal
- [ ] All existing roles work as before
- [ ] No auth errors or broken redirects
- [ ] RLS policies enforce correct access
- [ ] Seeds applied and verified
